# Page Object Model
## Introduction

* With the __Page Object Model__, page elements are initialized in a different page then used in the code normally.
* _Selenium_ provides a class & annotations to do this.
  * `@FindBy` & `FindBys` annotations will replace the `driver.findElement(By.*())` methods.
  * They can be used by all Select methods including _xpath_ & _cssselector_.
